# OpenSCAD libraries
This is collection of my OpenSCAD libraries I made over time. It started as one big `mixi-shapes.scad` file in my private repo, which now I'm making public and gradually splitting to multiple individual libraries. Each time some part of `mixi-shapes.scad` is moved to separate file, it is replaced by `include <>` directive to keep my old projects working.
